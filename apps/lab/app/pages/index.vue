 * resolution — the pipeline is the same either way, and a single frame is just
 * a take one frame long.
 *
 * Its own app rather than a docs route: none of this ships to readers, and the

  <!--
    The live stage. It has to be genuinely on screen and not display:none —
    most of these components start themselves from an IntersectionObserver,
    which reports nothing for a hidden element. So it sits pinned behind the
    UI at near-zero opacity, where it lays out and animates normally.

  <!--
    Outside `lab-chrome`, and carrying no theme of its own.

    Being outside is what stops the tool's theme from reaching the thing being
    filmed: these components are the site's, drawn with the site's tokens, and a
    plate rasterized under the panel's variables would come out in the lab's
    colours instead of the site's. It is `position: fixed`, so lifting it out of
    the flex row costs nothing in layout.

    Carrying nothing is the other half, and it is the half that is easy to get
    wrong. Putting `dark` here to shield it looks like the safe move and is not:
    a class on the element wins over a value inherited from `:root`, so the
    source stylesheet's `--ui-bg: zinc-950` lost to Nuxt UI's default `.dark`
    block and every export came out a step lighter than the site. The stage
    inherits from `<html>`, which stays dark, and the panel's theme never enters
    the room.

      Each instance is mounted at its clip's origin, not at the top of the
      take. Mounting is what starts these components, so the moment it happens
      is the moment their sequence begins — which is how a trimmed clip shows
      its source part-way through instead of replaying it from the beginning.
    -->
    <!--
      Every stage occupies the same corner, one on top of another.
      They used to stack down the page, which put the second one below the fold
      of a normal window — and these components start themselves from an
      IntersectionObserver at a 20% threshold. A clip whose stage was off screen
      therefore never started: its plate stayed on the initial state, and the
      take went blank for exactly the span of that clip. Capture reads each
      stage by element, not by what is painted, so overlapping costs nothing —
      and it means clip five sits precisely where clip one does, which is the
      only position known to be visible.
