/**
 * The docs sequencer, with the lab listening in.
 *
 * The staged components import it as `~/composables/useTimedSequence`, and `~`
 * resolves to whichever app is running them — so this app has to answer at that
 * path. That makes this file the seam: the docs app keeps one implementation and
 * knows nothing about the lab, while a component staged *here* also reports the
 * length it declared, so a clip can be cut to its animation instead of to a
 * guess. Running on the site, none of this exists.
