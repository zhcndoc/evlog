 * a subject on, centre marks to align to, a safe area to keep type inside of,
 * and rulers to read a position off. None of it is ever filmed — it lives in the
 * DOM, above the canvas, and the exporter never sees it.
 *
 * Drawn in neutral white at low alpha, never in the accent colour. Blue in this
 * app means "this is the thing you are acting on"; a permanent blue lattice
 * spends that meaning on scenery, and reads as an element of the shot rather
 * than as an instrument laid over it.
 *
 * The one part of the chrome that ignores the theme, and the only file where a
 * literal `white/…` is right. Everything here is drawn over the picture, and the
 * picture's background is a setting rather than a theme — putting the panel in a
 * light theme does not make the frame white, so a lattice that followed the panel
 * would go invisible against the shot it is there to measure.
 *
 * Built from CSS percentages rather than inside an SVG viewBox so the hairlines
 * stay one device pixel and the labels stay one size, whatever the frame is
 * scaled to on screen.
