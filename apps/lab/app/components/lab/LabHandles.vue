 * after each to see where it went — two numbers standing in for one gesture,
 * with the frame as the only place either of them means anything. This is that
 * gesture.
 *
 * The outline is a general quadrilateral rather than a rectangle, and that is
 * the whole reason it is drawn as a polygon: a layer in the scene is a plane in
 * perspective, so under any tilt its projection has four unequal sides. A box
 * with a centre and a size would be square to the screen while the thing it
 * claims to surround is not, which is worse than no box at all.

 * is on screen at the top-right, and an arrow pointing the wrong way across the
 * shape is worse than no arrow — it tells you the drag will do something it
 * will not.
 *
 * Taken from the corner's own diagonal turned by however far the box is turned
 * on screen — not from where the corner sits relative to the centre.
 *
 * Those are the same thing only on a square. On the wide, short box a caption
 * makes, both bottom corners sit within a few degrees of horizontal, so reading
 * their polar angle handed them a left-right arrow — the odd cursor on a corner
 * that plainly wants a diagonal one. A corner's direction is a property of which
 * corner it is, and the aspect ratio has nothing to say about it.
