/**
 * The take, laid out in time.
 *
 * Scrubbing turns a looping animation into something that can be inspected: a
 * frame can be held still and graded, and the interesting two seconds of a six
 * second sequence can be picked out instead of exporting all of it and trimming
 * it afterwards in another tool.
 *
 * The ruler is in component time — the clock the staged animation runs on — not
 * output time. Those differ whenever playback speed is not 1, and a segment has
 * to be chosen against what the component is doing, not against how long the
 * file will end up being.
 *
 * Every grab target is drawn. An invisible hit zone that only announces itself
 * by changing the cursor makes a timeline feel broken: the pointer flickers
 * between shapes with nothing on screen to explain why.
