/**
 * Imported media, stored once and referred to by what it is.
 *
 * A layer used to carry its file inline as a data URL. That made a document
 * self-contained, and made it enormous: base64 is a third bigger than the bytes
 * it encodes, local storage caps around five megabytes, a share link caps far
 * below that, and every undo snapshot had to reckon with the whole thing. The
 * same clip used twice was stored twice.
 *
 * Now a layer holds `asset:<hash>` and the bytes live in IndexedDB under that
 * hash. Two imports of the same file resolve to one record, a document is a few
 * kilobytes whatever it points at, and the bytes are handed to the decoder as a
 * `Blob` — which is also what a video element wants, so seeking got cheaper on
 * the way past.
 *
 * Old documents keep working untouched: `resolveSrc` returns anything that is
 * not an asset reference exactly as it found it, so a data URL saved last month
 * still draws.
