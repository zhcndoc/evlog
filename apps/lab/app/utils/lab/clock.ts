/**
 * A virtual clock for deterministic capture.
 *
 * Every animation in the docs is driven by `requestAnimationFrame(timestamp)` —
 * `useTimedSequence` integrates the delta between timestamps, and motion-v runs
 * its own rAF frameloop off `performance.now()`. Swap both for a clock we step
 * by hand and the whole page becomes a function of time.
 *
 * That is the difference between screen-recording a preview and rendering a
 * video: frames come out at exactly 1/fps apart no matter how long each one
 * actually took to produce, so a 60fps export stays smooth even when a single
 * frame needs 200ms of serialization and blur.
 *
 * Known limit: timers are not virtualized, and patching `setTimeout` globally is
 * a good way to deadlock an export on some unrelated library awaiting one — the
 * panel's own popovers and copy confirmations run off timers too, and freezing
 * those with the playhead would make the interface look broken.
 *
 * So a staged component has to animate off frames rather than off timers. Most
 * of them go through `useTimedSequence`, which does. One that reaches for
 * `setTimeout` keeps running while the playhead is still, restarts nothing when
 * a take is replayed, and drifts from anything beside it that is on the frame
 * clock — which is not a limitation of this file so much as the contract it
 * asks of what it films.
