/**
 * The one database, opened once.
 *
 * Local storage holds the working copy and nothing else now: it is synchronous,
 * which is what lets a session open on the shot it closed on without waiting for
 * anything, and it caps around five megabytes, which is fine for a document and
 * hopeless for a video. So the bytes live here instead — IndexedDB stores real
 * `Blob`s, has a quota measured in gigabytes, and never asks for base64.
 *
 * Deliberately hand-rolled rather than wrapped in a library. Two object stores
 * and four operations do not need one, and the whole point of the lab running
 * entirely in the browser is that it carries nothing it does not use.
