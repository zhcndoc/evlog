/**
 * The workspace the content subagents share.
 *
 * A declared subagent inherits nothing from the root, sandbox included, and
 * eve prewarms one template per subagent at build time. Re-exporting the root
 * definition therefore built the root's template three times: clone, install,
 * the full lint, typecheck, and test run, Chromium, and the before-after CLI,
 * once for the root and once per content subagent. That tripled the deploy and
 * was the slowest way to find out that any of them can fail.
 *
 * These two read pages and write pages. They run no checks, drive no browser,
 * and capture nothing, so the template stops at a checkout. There is not even
 * an install: `scripts/content-lint` imports node builtins and its own files,
 * nothing else, and the pass runs its verification in the root session after
 * the rewrite comes back. A checkout with no `node_modules` is also a checkout
 * with nothing to go stale when `onSession` moves it to the current `main`.
