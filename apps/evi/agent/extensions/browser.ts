 * hash-named preview deployments reachable; a protected preview's redirect to
 * vercel.com falls outside the list and is blocked. Loopback is allowed
 * because the sandbox runs no listener Evi did not start herself. The
 * extension exposes no cookie/storage/auth-state commands, so session state
 * is never readable through the tool surface; pages can still set runtime
 * cookies while a session lives.
