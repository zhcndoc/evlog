Custom events use \`count_events\` and \`aggregate_events\`. \`filter\` is OData, e.g. \`requestPath eq '/docs'\`. Web Analytics is browser-oriented and must not be used to estimate curl, MCP, or raw Markdown traffic.`,
  `- Agent-facing HTTP usage (includes CDN/static requests Web Analytics misses): call \`create_observability_query\` with \`requestBody={ metric: 'vercel.request.count', aggregation: 'sum', startTime, endTime, scope: { type: 'project', ownerId: '${ TEAM_ID }', projectIds: ['<project id>'] } }\` and \`teamId='${ TEAM_ID }'\`.
