 * The published evlog skills, installed by delegating to `npx skills`.

 * We do not copy skill files ourselves. Every agent reads a different directory
 * (`.claude/skills`, `.agents/skills`, `.codex/skills`, …), the skills CLI
 * already resolves that per agent, symlinks a canonical copy, and owns
 * `update` / `remove` / `list` — and it keeps no manifest, so anything we wrote
 * behind its back would be a second copy it could never update.
 *
 * So this module does two things: notice when the skills are already there, and
 * shell out when they are not. Same shape as `init` running the package manager
 * rather than unpacking a tarball itself.
