/**
 * Create a request-scoped `AsyncLocalStorage` and matching `useLogger`
 * accessor. Every framework that exposes `useLogger()` (Express, Fastify,
 * NestJS, SvelteKit) calls this once at module level.
 *
 * Prefer `import { createLoggerStorage } from 'evlog/toolkit/storage'` on
 * Cloudflare Workers / edge so `node:async_hooks` is not pulled through the
 * main `evlog/toolkit` barrel. The barrel still re-exports this helper for
 * compatibility — remove that re-export at the next major (#403).
 *
 * @param contextHint - Appended to the error message when `useLogger()` is
 *   called outside of a request, e.g. `"middleware context. Make sure
 *   app.use(evlog()) is registered before your routes."`.
 * @param id - Stable identifier for the shared storage slot. Copies of evlog
 *   duplicated by the package manager resolve the same instance for a given
 *   `id`, so a request opened by one copy is visible to the other. Defaults to
 *   `contextHint`; third-party callers should pass a namespaced id.
