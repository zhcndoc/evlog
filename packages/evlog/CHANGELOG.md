# evlog

## 2.26.0

### Minor Changes

- [#556](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/556) [`15b292d`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/15b292d2e824f90738b69ccdfb3ba41da3710f16) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Link PostHog logs to people and session replays, and add a compact OTLP record shape.

  The PostHog adapter now sends `posthogDistinctId` (from `userId`) and `sessionId` as log attributes, which is how PostHog surfaces a log on a person's profile and links it to their session replay. Both sources are configurable and accept dot paths:

  ```ts
  createPostHogDrain({
    distinctIdField: "user.id",
    sessionIdField: "session.id",
  });
  ```

  In `mode: 'events'`, events without a resolvable identity are now sent as anonymous PostHog events (`$process_person_profile: false`) instead of being attributed to a person named after the service. A numeric `userId` is used as the identifier rather than discarded.

  The `otlp`, `posthog`, and `hyperdx` adapters accept a new `recordShape` option. `'compact'` sends a one-line body (`POST /api/checkout (500)`) and flattens nested fields into dotted attributes (`user.id`, `ai.costUsd`) that backends can filter and break down by:

  ```ts
  createOTLPDrain({ recordShape: "compact" });
  ```

  In `mode: 'events'`, `'compact'` flattens the same way, so nested fields become properties the PostHog UI can filter and break down by rather than one opaque object.

  The default stays `'json'` — the whole event in the body, one attribute per top-level field, nested properties untouched — so existing records and the queries built on them are unchanged. `'compact'` becomes the default in the next major.

### Patch Changes

- [`ebed9cf`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/ebed9cf8936672552ebb2ed125f3722b53c183ba) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Qualify the eve turn `requestId` with its session id.

  eve numbers turns within a session, so `turn_0` is the first turn of every session. Recording it as `requestId` made the field non-unique — every single-turn session produced the same value, which is unusable as a correlation key in a drain. The wide event now reports `<sessionId>:<turnId>`, and `evlogRuntimeContext` stamps the same value on the model-call spans so a trace still joins to the event it belongs to. `eve.sessionId` and `eve.turnId` are unchanged.

## 2.25.0

### Minor Changes

- [#501](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/501) [`16d5323`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/16d5323efb132fead23643bc002d2411d1f48124) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Cover the eve 0.30 event surface. **`evlog/eve` now requires eve >= 0.30** — the peer range moves from `>=0.24.3`. The eve integration is still beta and its peer floor moves with it, so this ships as a minor; nothing outside `evlog/eve` is affected. Agents on an older eve keep working on the previous evlog — upgrade eve first.

  The wide event now carries what eve started reporting since 0.24:
  - `eve.runtime` — eve version, agent id, model, and the deployed git sha, branch and date, from `session.started`
  - `eve.parent` — parent and root session ids for a subagent run, so a drain can rebuild the delegation tree
  - `eve.authorizations` — connection sign-ins with their outcome, reason and duration; a turn parked on one ends as `eve.phase: 'awaiting-authorization'`
  - `eve.compaction` — how many compactions ran, on which model, and how full the context was when the first one triggered
  - `eve.contextCleared`, `eve.stepFailures` and `eve.failedSteps` — a model call that failed and was retried no longer disappears from a turn that ends up succeeding
  - `ai.costUsd` — the cost eve reports, used in place of the `cost` pricing map when available. `ai.model` falls back to the model reported at session start, so `model` is only needed for dynamic-model agents
  - subagents record `durationMs` and a `started` status

  `message` replaces `redactMessage` with three modes: `'omit'` (default), `'preview'` (text truncated to `messagePreviewLength`, attachments reduced to their type and media type) and `'full'`. Attachment parts were previously not redacted at all. `redactMessage` still works and is deprecated.

  `sessionEvent: true` adds one wide event per session on top of the per-turn ones, rolling up turns, tokens, cost, tools used, compactions and authorizations — one row per conversation, which is what makes tail sampling useful on an agent.

- [#506](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/506) [`f8fb677`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/f8fb677d5a267d2a25bca52bff2453b5f0c1bdf2) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Close the remaining gaps in the eve integration, and add `defineEvlogInstrumentation()`.

  A wide event and an Agent Runs span describe the same turn, but nothing joined them: you could not jump from a trace in Braintrust, Datadog or the Vercel dashboard to the event in your drain. Export the new definition from `agent/instrumentation.ts` and every model-call span carries `evlog.request_id` and `evlog.session_id`, the values the wide event reports as `requestId` and `eve.sessionId`:

  ```ts
  // agent/instrumentation.ts
  import { defineEvlogInstrumentation } from "evlog/eve";

  export default defineEvlogInstrumentation();
  ```

  Without `setup`, OpenTelemetry export is untouched and eve keeps writing its local traces. `functionId`, `recordInputs`, `recordOutputs` and `traceChannelRequests` pass through to eve.

  Three more of eve's stream events now reach the wide event:
  - `eve.reasoning` — `blocks` and `chars`, the size of the model's thinking. The reasoning text itself is never recorded.
  - `message.responseChars`, and `message.response` once `message` is `'preview'` or `'full'` — the agent's answer, following the same rule as the incoming message.
  - `eve.result` — the structured result of an agent with an output schema.

- [#507](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/507) [`1838d60`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/1838d609ed41f973a48ebf62dc0557a16117221d) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - `evlog/eve` records the caller, and composes with another observability backend.

  An agent has exactly one `agent/instrumentation.ts`, and every observability item in eve's registry writes it. `defineEvlogInstrumentation()` owns that file, so it only fits an agent whose instrumentation is evlog's alone. The new `evlogRuntimeContext` contributes evlog's span attributes to instrumentation you already have, the way the other integrations do:

  ```ts
  import { defineInstrumentation } from 'eve/instrumentation'
  import { evlogRuntimeContext } from 'evlog/eve'

  export default defineInstrumentation({
    setup: ({ agentName }) => registerOTel({ serviceName: agentName, spanProcessors: [...] }),
    events: {
      'step.started': input => ({
        runtimeContext: {
          ...evlogRuntimeContext(input),
          posthog_distinct_id: input.session.auth.current?.principalId ?? '',
        },
      }),
    },
  })
  ```

  It returns `undefined` outside a tracked turn, so spreading it adds nothing.

  Turn and session events now carry `eve.caller` with the principal eve resolved at dispatch: `principalId`, `principalType` and `authenticator`. On a multi-user channel that is the dimension you group cost, volume and refusals by, and it was previously unreachable — the enrich hook is HTTP-shaped and exposes no path to the eve session. `subject` and `attributes` are deliberately excluded, since a channel may put a name or an email in them.

### Patch Changes

- [#500](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/500) [`8ffba92`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/8ffba925f5fedb94cce782aa173011cde0245ace) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Emit a wide event for eve turns that end without `turn.completed` or `turn.failed`.

  A turn cancelled by eve produced no wide event, and its logger, accumulator and session slot stayed in memory for good: LRU eviction skips any session that still has an active turn, so nothing ever reclaimed them. `turn.cancelled` now closes the turn on its own terminal path — status `499`, `eve.phase: 'cancelled'`, level `info`, because cancellation is not a failure in eve's model.

  `session.failed` and `session.completed` flush any turn still open for that session and drop its carried-over context, which also ends the indefinite retention of snapshots for finished sessions.

- [#510](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/510) [`68b05fa`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/68b05fa1456ee3b7d6cfe9e34abe3175c74cb5d0) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - The file system drain now detects an unwritable directory reliably.

  The previous check probed with `mkdir({ recursive: true })`, which is a no-op on a directory that already exists and therefore succeeds even when that directory is read-only. A deployment whose log directory already existed still threw on every batch. The probe also ran per call rather than per resolved state, so concurrent batches could each warn.

  The write itself is now the check: once an append fails with `EROFS`, `EACCES` or `EPERM`, the drain is disabled for that directory and warns once. Batches already in flight when that happens still attempt their own append. Any other failure, including a full disk, is reported by the drain as before.

- [#509](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/509) [`2dfde11`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/2dfde11d5c79a2b119a5c64110dc25d0e2f43656) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - The file system drain disables itself when its directory is not writable.

  `createFsDrain()` guarded neither its `mkdir` nor its `appendFile`, so attaching it on a serverless host — where everything outside the temp directory is read-only — threw once per batch for the lifetime of the deployment, and the events went nowhere regardless. Callers had to guess at the environment to avoid it:

  ```ts
  // no longer needed
  const drain = process.env.VERCEL !== "1" ? createFsDrain() : undefined;
  ```

  The drain now disables itself once it observes an `EROFS`, `EACCES` or `EPERM` write failure for that directory, warning a single time, the same way it already disables itself in the Edge runtime. Attach it unconditionally. Any other failure — a full disk, a genuine bug — still propagates.

## 2.24.0

### Minor Changes

- [#495](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/495) [`c739cf8`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/c739cf87aa2dfbc72dd9d868b688fdf7bed5d8dd) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - feat: publish wide events on a `node:diagnostics_channel`

  New opt-in entry point `evlog/diagnostics`. Call `enableDiagnosticsChannel()` once at startup and every emitted wide event is published on the `evlog.event` channel:

  ```ts
  // server/plugins/evlog-diagnostics.ts
  import { enableDiagnosticsChannel } from "evlog/diagnostics";

  export default defineNitroPlugin(async () => {
    await enableDiagnosticsChannel();
  });
  ```

  A consumer then subscribes by channel name alone, with no evlog import and no entry in `initLogger()`:

  ```ts
  import { subscribe } from "node:diagnostics_channel";

  subscribe("evlog.event", ({ event }) =>
    metrics.timing("http.request", event.durationMs),
  );
  ```

  `subscribeToWideEvents()` is exported for consumers that already depend on evlog and want the payload typed.

  Subscribers receive the same object drains receive — post-audit, post-redaction, post-enrich — and must treat it as read-only. They run synchronously and are not awaited: this is an observation side channel, not a transport. On Cloudflare, Workers forwards every channel message to a Tail Worker, so enabling it gets wide events out of an isolate with no drain and no `waitUntil`.

  Off by default, and free when off — `node:diagnostics_channel` is loaded lazily so it never enters the main bundle graph, and with the channel enabled but unsubscribed the emit path benchmarks identically to having it disabled.

- [#494](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/494) [`44705f7`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/44705f7bd90ef2d903e9a10beea7a704c724e50e) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - feat(core): expose `durationMs` as a number on the wide event

  Request loggers now write `durationMs` (a number, in milliseconds) next to the existing `duration` string. `duration` keeps its current shape — `"12ms"`, `"1.20s"` — and is still what the pretty terminal renders; `durationMs` is the one to query. Backends stop needing a parse step: ClickHouse can `avg()` and `quantile(0.95)()` on a real column, LogQL can do `| json | durationMs > 1000`, and facet-based UIs get a numeric field instead of a string.

  The ClickHouse adapter's default `toClickHouseRow()` maps it to a new `duration_ms` column. Add it to an existing table before upgrading:

  ```sql
  ALTER TABLE evlog_events ADD COLUMN duration_ms Nullable(UInt32) AFTER duration;
  ```

  Durations are measured with a clamped elapsed helper, so a backward wall-clock step (NTP, manual change) during a request can no longer surface a negative `durationMs`, `duration`, or tail-sampling duration.

  `BaseWideEvent` now declares both fields, so `event.durationMs` is typed `number | undefined` in enrichers and drains. Code that read `event.duration` as a number was already wrong at runtime and will now fail to type-check — switch it to `event.durationMs`.

## 2.23.0

### Minor Changes

- [#473](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/473) [`f39ab30`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/f39ab30d90af608acb1527a766d4823460dc99bd) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - refactor: build each adapter's HTTP request once instead of twice — every HTTP adapter (`axiom`, `better-stack`, `datadog`, `otlp`, `sentry`, `posthog` in `events` mode) constructed its URL, headers and body in two places: the `encode()` passed to `defineHttpDrain()` and again inside its standalone `sendBatchTo*` helper. The two copies had already drifted, reporting the same failure under different names (`axiom API error` from the drain, `Axiom API error` from the helper), and Axiom's and Better Stack's `encode()` ignored the deprecated `token` / `sourceToken` aliases the helper honoured. Both paths now share one encoder per adapter and report failures identically. `defineHttpDrain()` accepts an optional `label` for the human-readable name used in error messages, and `sendEncodedDrainRequest()` is exported from `evlog/toolkit` so custom adapters can reuse their own encoder the same way

- [#481](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/481) [`d7f482a`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/d7f482aa41ad696db21ba07ffaaa355bf7fd0b56) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - feat(clickhouse): add the ClickHouse drain adapter (`evlog/clickhouse`) — `createClickHouseDrain()` inserts wide events over ClickHouse's HTTP interface in `JSONEachRow` format, working with a local instance, a self-managed cluster, and ClickHouse Cloud. The default `evlog_events` schema keeps typed columns for what you filter and aggregate on (`timestamp`, `level`, `service`, `environment`, `request_id`, `trace_id`, `method`, `path`, `status`, …) plus the complete event as JSON in `data`, so adding a field to your events never needs a migration; pass `transform` to target your own schema. Asynchronous inserts are enabled and not awaited by default (`async_insert=1&wait_for_async_insert=0`), so ClickHouse batches server-side instead of creating one MergeTree part per request and draining never blocks on disk writes. Credentials are sent as `X-ClickHouse-User` / `X-ClickHouse-Key` headers rather than query parameters, so they never reach `system.query_log`. Configured via `CLICKHOUSE_ENDPOINT` / `CLICKHOUSE_USER` / `CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD` / `CLICKHOUSE_DATABASE` / `CLICKHOUSE_TABLE` or overrides, with `sendToClickHouse` / `sendBatchToClickHouse` for direct use. The adapter docs carry the matching `CREATE TABLE`.

- [#465](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/465) [`12852d3`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/12852d31ad10e990091c6cb1740d201fb9fc95ac) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - fix(datadog): lift `event.traceId` / `event.spanId` into a root `dd` block — Datadog's log-to-trace correlation only reads `dd.trace_id` / `dd.span_id` at the payload root, so the ids `createDefaultEnrichers()` already sets arrived nested under `evlog` and never correlated. The nested copy stays, so `@evlog.*` facets keep working, and `resolveDatadogTraceContext` is exported for custom drains

- [#468](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/468) [`ecc3ea6`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/ecc3ea60db28d7513c515958f127af6a1ec6a0d5) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - fix(core): key request scope, logger config and error identity to a versioned `globalThis` registry — evlog declares 18 optional peers, and pnpm/bun (isolated linker) hash resolved peers into store paths, so two workspaces that resolve `ai` or `zod` differently end up with physically distinct copies of the _same_ evlog version. Each copy used to carry its own `AsyncLocalStorage` (so `useLogger()` threw inside another copy's `withEvlog()`), its own logger configuration (so events emitted through the second copy were silently undrained and unredacted), and its own `EvlogError` class (so `instanceof` downgraded structured errors to bare 500s). All three are now shared per major version. `createLoggerStorage()` takes an optional storage id, and `EvlogError.isEvlogError()` replaces `instanceof` for cross-copy checks

- [#471](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/471) [`4e12ebb`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/4e12ebbbc33a04d8cc77c7bf09edce418466d804) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - refactor: route `evlog/nestjs`, `evlog/react-router` and `evlog/sveltekit` through `defineFrameworkIntegration()` — the three integrations each rebuilt the same request extraction, `crypto.randomUUID()` fallback, `attachForkToLogger()` call and `storage.run()` wrapper by hand instead of using the helper Hono, Express, Elysia, Fastify and oRPC already share. Behaviour is unchanged, but they now inherit anything the helper gains (including `waitUntil` extraction) for free. A new `pickBaseEvlogOptions()` toolkit export becomes the single place listing the `BaseEvlogOptions` fields, replacing the copy in `toMiddlewareOptions()` and the hand-written field list in `evlog/eve` — which silently dropped `waitUntil`, and would have dropped every option added later

- [#476](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/476) [`35431c2`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/35431c2685a10b0448e22fd416a9b37e626ec1e0) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - feat(hono): export `useLogger()` and enable `log.fork()` — Hono was the only framework integration without `useLogger()`, so reaching the request logger from a service or repository meant threading the Hono `Context` down through every call. `import { useLogger } from 'evlog/hono'` now resolves the same logger `c.get('log')` returns, and `c.get('log')` is unchanged — it stays the idiomatic accessor inside route handlers. Attaching AsyncLocalStorage also enables `log.fork()` on Hono, for background work that emits its own wide event correlated by `_parentRequestId`.

  **Cloudflare Workers:** `useLogger()` is backed by `AsyncLocalStorage`, so `evlog/hono` now imports `node:async_hooks`. Workers deployments need the `nodejs_compat` (or `nodejs_als`) compatibility flag in `wrangler.toml`. If you cannot enable it, use `evlog/workers`, which stays free of `node:async_hooks` by design.

- [#480](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/480) [`1b0edb8`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/1b0edb80b080b3c03fc2f60e848191fac2a6a2f7) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - feat(loki): add the Grafana Loki drain adapter (`evlog/loki`) — `createLokiDrain()` pushes wide events to Loki's push API, covering self-hosted single-tenant, multi-tenant (`X-Scope-OrgID`), and Grafana Cloud (instance ID + token as HTTP Basic). Each event is pushed as a JSON log line under a deliberately small label set — `service`, `environment`, `level` by default — so Loki's index stays cheap while everything else (`requestId`, `path`, custom fields) remains queryable with `| json`. Promote extra fields with `labelFields`, add deployment-wide labels with `labels`. Events sharing a label set are grouped into one stream and sorted by timestamp, since Loki rejects out-of-order entries. Configured via `LOKI_ENDPOINT` / `LOKI_API_KEY` / `LOKI_USER` / `LOKI_TENANT_ID` or overrides, with `sendToLoki` / `sendBatchToLoki` for direct use.

- [#474](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/474) [`c5e85b0`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/c5e85b0b121a60b69699b4f6f2fe5831dee62f19) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - refactor(next): run `withEvlog()` through the shared middleware pipeline — `evlog/next` reimplemented the whole request pipeline (route filtering, per-route service, tail sampling, emit, enrich, drain) instead of calling `createMiddlewareLogger`, so it silently drifted from every other integration. Two options declared on `NextEvlogOptions` never did anything: `plugins` was never applied, because Next built no plugin runner at all, and global `sampling.keep` tail conditions were never evaluated — Next only called the user's `keep` callback, and its tail context carried no `duration`, so duration-based keep rules could not match. Both now work. `keep` callbacks also receive `ctx.duration`, and error statuses are derived through the shared `extractErrorStatus`. Next's `after()` is wired as the pipeline's `waitUntil`, so drain work still runs after the response is sent; enrich now runs before the response returns, matching the documented `waitUntil` contract and every other integration — move latency-sensitive work into `drain` if you relied on enrich being deferred

- [#466](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/466) [`5d99391`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/5d99391638a13bb7ea3a8b98f3ac71e07b9b72cb) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Make emit-time redaction programmable

  `RedactConfig.replacement` now accepts a function, so a replacement can be derived from the value it replaces instead of being a constant — a stable fingerprint keeps requests correlatable without exposing the credential:

  ```ts
  initLogger({
    redact: {
      patterns: [/\/public\/claim\/([A-Za-z0-9._-]{12,})/g],
      replacement: (_match, ctx) =>
        `/public/claim/[tok:${fingerprint(ctx.groups[0])}]`,
    },
  });
  ```

  `RedactConfig.transform` covers policies that cannot be expressed declaratively — conditional on a sibling field, tenant-scoped, or allowlist-shaped. It runs before the declarative stages, so it sees raw values and `paths` / `builtins` / `patterns` still apply to whatever it leaves behind.

  Both run where redaction already runs: after the event is built, before the console write and before any drain. Failures are caught and reported like drain failures — a `replacement` function that throws or returns a non-string falls back to `[REDACTED]` rather than emitting the raw value, and a throwing `transform` is skipped without stopping the event from being logged.

  Function-valued policy cannot survive the build-time config bridges, which serialize to JSON; the Nitro modules now warn instead of dropping it silently.

- [#472](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/472) [`2540aa5`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/2540aa5eb526f9cd25a637cde1bc7115575a280e) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - feat(workers): add `withEvlog()` so Cloudflare Workers get the full middleware pipeline — `evlog/workers` was the only integration that never ran `createMiddlewareLogger`, so `include` / `exclude`, per-route `routes` overrides, `redact`, `enrich`, `keep` tail sampling and `plugins` simply had no effect there. Wrap your fetch handler with `withEvlog(handler, options)` and the wide event is emitted for you when the handler returns, with the same option surface every other framework accepts; `ctx.waitUntil` is picked up from the third argument so drains outlive the response, streaming bodies defer the emit until they complete, and `requestId` now honours `x-request-id` before falling back to `cf-ray`. `defineWorkerFetch()` and `createWorkersLogger()` are unchanged and remain the manual-emit path. The entrypoint stays free of `node:async_hooks`, so it still runs without `nodejs_compat`

### Patch Changes

- [#457](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/457) [`899464a`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/899464a6c4a2dcf0a2816ddd39eb74203c4d4a82) Thanks [@EmilGramDK](https://github.com/EmilGramDK)! - fix(core): redact own enumerable fields only, so getter-only prototype accessors such as `DOMException.code` are never assigned to. A field that still refuses the write now warns instead of throwing, and redaction keeps covering the own fields of class instances.

- [#477](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/477) [`f5d7474`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/f5d7474232379a3346f2dfa8e23335b4a9bfa44a) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - fix(core): serialize Error instances passed to the client `log.error()` — `name`, `message` and `stack` are non-enumerable, so an `Error` spread into a wide event contributed nothing and the call emitted an event with no error at all. The docs teach `log.error(new Error(...))` for Next.js client components, and the type only accepted a tag pair or a plain object, so the pattern failed to type check as well. Errors now land under `error` with the same shape the server logger stores, including `code`, `status`, `cause` and friends

For an SSE or chunked body that is long before the stream finishes, so anything the handler set mid-stream (AI token counts, tool calls, final status) was dropped with a post-emit `[evlog]` warning. Streaming responses are now claimed in `mapResponse` and their body wrapped, so the emit waits for the stream to close — the same behaviour Hono, oRPC, SvelteKit, React Router and Next already had ([#321](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/issues/321)). Non-streaming responses are unaffected and still emit immediately.

A handler that logs the error it then throws hands the same instance to `log.error()` and to the integration's `finish({ error })`; the second merge walked into the caller's own object and threw on any read-only field it carried.

They join Loki and ClickHouse under `hybrid/`, and each page now splits its setup into explicit self-hosted and managed sections rather than mixing the two. The old `/integrate/adapters/cloud/otlp` and `/integrate/adapters/cloud/hyperdx` URLs 301 to the new locations.

These APIs throw an internal Next.js control-flow signal that isn't a real error — `withEvlog` now detects it via `unstable_rethrow` and rethrows it untouched instead of logging and emitting an error event.

The hook locked the original response body via `getReader()` and assigned the wrapped response to `event.res`, which is a getter-only accessor on h3 v2, producing `Attempted to assign to readonly property` followed by `ReadableStream is locked` and a 500 for the client. Streaming responses now pass through untouched and the wide event is emitted at header time; stream-lifetime metrics are not observable from h3 v2's `onResponse` hook, which cannot replace the outgoing response.

The main `evlog/toolkit` barrel still re-exports it for compatibility; prefer `evlog/toolkit/storage` when you need to keep `node:async_hooks` out of bundles that do not tree-shake unused exports.

On v7, embeddings are auto-captured via `onEmbedEnd` when telemetry is enabled, and abort/error lifecycle events are written to the wide event. Pass the integration via `telemetry.integrations` (v7) or `experimental_telemetry.integrations` (v6). Exports a new `EvlogTelemetry` type.

Tracks tool durations (including post-approval resumes), session context carry-over with LRU eviction (`maxSessions`), slim `eve.phase` / `eve.sessionTurns` fields, and compact HITL `approval`. The turn logger is bound via AsyncLocalStorage on `turn.started`; pass `ctx` when ALS is unavailable. Turn state is shared via `globalThis` when eve bundles hooks and tools separately. `finalizeAudit()` no longer crashes on partial `audit` objects missing `actor` fields. Fixes `_auditForceKeep` leaking on force-kept events and skips Nitro runtime probes on Next.js hosts.

  Cloudflare Workers omit native `AsyncLocalStorage.enterWith()`. The Elysia integration now installs a small polyfill on load so `useLogger()` keeps working in typical `wrangler dev` flows. `{ log }` from derive remains the safest option when multiple requests may interleave in the same isolate.

  `useLogger()`, `c.get('log')`, `req.log`, and other integration surfaces now return `AuditableLogger` instead of `RequestLogger`, so `.audit()` type-checks without optional chaining. Matches runtime behavior from `createRequestLogger()`.

  Non-Node bundlers (Convex, etc.) failed when importing `defineErrorCatalog` from `evlog` because the main bundle transitively referenced `node:crypto` and `pretty-error-snippet.node` (`node:fs`, `node:path`, `node:module`). The audit signer now uses `globalThis.crypto.subtle` only, disk snippet loading is registered from Node-only integration entrypoints instead of `initLogger`, and catalog utilities live in a dedicated `evlog/catalog` subpath backed by a lean `audit-action` module.

  With `evlog/nuxt` installed, every non-API SSR error (404/500) was returned as raw Nitro JSON instead of rendering the framework error page. The Nitro error handler now delegates document/HTML navigations to the next handler in Nitro's chain (Nuxt's `error.vue` renderer) while still serializing JSON for API routes and `EvlogError` responses.

  Closes [#390](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/issues/390)

- [#384](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/384) [`6eb0957`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/6eb0957d03c69fffbac2390c6e2bc84cf42fbb4b) Thanks [@nadaniels](https://github.com/nadaniels)! - fix(hono): resolve "ReadableStream is locked" error with AI SDK streaming responses

  Using `createUIMessageStreamResponse` or `createAgentUIStreamResponse` from the Vercel AI SDK inside a Hono route would throw `ERR_INVALID_STATE: ReadableStream is locked` when running under `@hono/node-server`.

  **Root cause:** The middleware called `createObservedBody(c.res.body)` (which calls `body.getReader()`, locking the stream) and then relied on Hono's `compose` to update `c.res` with the wrapped response via the middleware return value. However, Hono skips that update when `context.finalized` is already `true` — which is always the case after a route handler returns a `Response`. This left `c.res` pointing at the original response whose body was now locked, so `@hono/node-server`'s subsequent `response.body.getReader()` call threw.

  **Fix:** Explicitly assign `c.res = await finishResponse(c.res, ...)` instead of returning the wrapped response, so `c.res` is always updated regardless of `context.finalized`.

  The OTLP adapter now also accepts the shorter `OTLP_ENDPOINT` / `OTLP_HEADERS` env vars as aliases for the standard `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` / `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS`.

Next.js dev stacks are source-mapped to original TypeScript (like Nitro) via a Next-only enricher that does not bundle nitropack/youch; stored stacks are compacted in dev (production stacks are kept intact) and useless `.next`/`node:` snippet previews are skipped. The primary `at` line now points at your route/handler file instead of Next `route-modules` internals.

- [#373](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/373) [`4c51970`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/4c5197095b9717c9f725b52c0796d1b6b62814cc) Thanks [@jmcgoldrick](https://github.com/jmcgoldrick)! - Fix `evlog/nitro/v3` pulling in the optional `h3` peer. The v3 plugin shared a deferred-drain helper from the v2 module, which imports `getHeaders` from `h3`, so the v3 bundle referenced `h3` even though the v3 runtime never uses it. Consumers that don't install `h3` directly (e.g. Nitro v3 / TanStack Start on Vite) failed to build with `"getHeaders" is not exported by "__vite-optional-peer-dep:h3:evlog"`. The helper now lives in an h3-free module, so the v3 path no longer references `h3`.

Filter known Next.js Edge bundler warnings from `captureOutput` (`CaptureOutputOptions`: `stdout`, `stderr`, `ignore`). The FS adapter warns once and skips writes when `NEXT_RUNTIME` is `edge`.

The Nitro v2 error handler now ends the Node response directly instead of relying on h3 `send()`, so clients receive the expected JSON error response.

- [#376](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/376) [`4c13bb0`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/4c13bb0043c5acca4bd8e99638740396a557ead0) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Hardening and performance improvements across the package:
  - **Redaction**: path matchers are now precompiled once per resolved config instead of on every event, and case-insensitive leaf lookups are O(1).
  - **Pipeline**: the idle flush scheduling timer is `unref()`'d so it never holds a Node process open on shutdown — call `flush()` to deliver buffered events before exit (unchanged, documented contract). Retry backoff timers stay ref'd so in-flight batches are not dropped mid-retry.
  - **Ingest endpoint**: request bodies are capped at 32KB (413 beyond) and parsed as strict JSON.
  - **Audit**: `stableStringify` guards against circular references in audit `changes` instead of recursing forever; shared (non-circular) references keep stable signatures.
  - **Toolkit**: new `applyDeprecatedAlias` helper to map deprecated config fields onto their replacement with a one-time warning, used by the Axiom and Better Stack adapters.
  - **Vite**: warns when `sourceLocation` is enabled for a production build (source paths embedded in the client bundle).
  - Published packages now declare `engines.node >= 18`.

  **Presets:** `dev: 'evlog' | 'nitro' | 'both'` — controls Nitro's Youch overlay (`frameworkOverlay`) and how much stack detail evlog prints in the wide event (`prettyError.detail`). Default in pretty dev is `'evlog'` (no Nitro overlay, full evlog error block). `'nitro'` keeps Nitro's stack and prints only message + Why/Fix/link in the wide event. `'both'` shows both full outputs.

  **Explicit object:** `dev: { frameworkOverlay, prettyError: { snippet, stackDepth, compact, detail: 'full' | 'guidance' } }`.

  Other improvements: tighter error blocks by default (`prettyError.compact`), tree spacers, hanging-indent Why/Fix wrapping, `stdout` for error wide events in dev, source-mapped file:line via Nitro `loadStackTrace`, Nitro error hook enrich+drain no longer blocks HTTP responses.

Single-segment patterns like `password` are shorthand for `**.password` (any nesting depth). Key-name globs (`*_token`) and path globs (`user.*`) are supported. `auditRedactPreset` simplified to path globs.

  initLogger({

  Applies to Next.js `withEvlog`, SvelteKit, Hono, React Router, oRPC, and Nitro/Nuxt integrations. Also merges late `ai` fields onto an emitted event before enrich/drain when metadata arrives in a narrow race window.

The Nuxt module now bakes evlog options into `nitro.options.replace.__EVLOG_CONFIG__` (matching standalone Nitro modules), so the Nitro plugin receives `silent: true` and no longer emits an unenriched log line before your `evlog:drain` hook runs.

Wide events are now deep-cloned before redaction, so `log.info({ user })` and `createLogger().emit()` only scrub the emitted copy sent to console and drains.

## 2.18.1

### Patch Changes

- [#340](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/340) [`cfc9322`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/cfc932289aa5192706c70bb728afebad560a17e5) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Fix a runtime crash on Vercel + Bun + Nitro v3 where every request failed with `bun is unable to write files: ReadOnlyFileSystem`. The Nitro plugin probed `nitro/runtime-config` at runtime to read evlog's config; that module transitively imports the build-only `#nitro/virtual/runtime-config`, which doesn't exist in deployed bundles. On Vercel + Bun the missing virtual triggered Bun's package auto-installer, which tried to write `node_modules/.cache` and crashed on the read-only function filesystem.

  The Nitro modules now bake the evlog config into the bundle as a literal via `nitro.options.replace.__EVLOG_CONFIG__`. The shared config bridge reads that build-time literal first and skips all runtime probing — no `import('nitro/runtime-config')`, no env propagation guesswork. The bridge also exposes the inlined value as a synthetic `{ evlog: <inlined> }` record, so drain adapters resolving `runtimeConfig.evlog.<adapter>` never trigger the probe either.

  For defense-in-depth, the bridge additionally scopes its dynamic-import fallback to the major version declared by the plugin (new internal `setActiveNitroRuntime` helper) — `nitro/runtime-config` for v3, `nitropack/...` for v2 — so standalone use outside a plugin (e.g. adapters called from non-Nitro code) doesn't probe both versions.

  No public-API change.

  Closes [#312](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/issues/312).

## 2.18.0

### Minor Changes

- [#351](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/351) [`ee997b3`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/ee997b311b4b59cf319c0fbd5efae4a7ac10e30c) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add `evlog/memory` — an in-memory ring buffer drain that works in any runtime, including Cloudflare Workers (workerd) where Node's `fs` module is unavailable.

  ```ts
  import {
    createMemoryDrain,
    readMemoryLogs,
    clearMemoryLogs,
    parseReadMemoryLogsQuery,
  } from "evlog/memory";

  // Wire the drain
  app.use(evlog({ drain: createMemoryDrain() }));

  // Expose a dev-only endpoint — agents can filter via query params
  app.get("/_evlog/logs", (c) =>
    c.json(readMemoryLogs(parseReadMemoryLogsQuery(c.req.query()))),
  );
  ```

  Key features:
  - **Zero runtime dependencies** — pure in-memory, no `fs`, no network
  - **Bounded ring buffer** — configurable `maxEvents` (default `1000`) prevents unbounded memory growth
  - **Named stores** — isolate buffers per service or test suite via the `store` option
  - **Filtering API** — `readMemoryLogs` accepts `since`, `until`, `level`, `filter`, and `limit` options, matching the `readFsLogs` interface
  - **`parseReadMemoryLogsQuery(query)`** — coerce HTTP query-string params (`Record<string, string>`) into typed `ReadMemoryLogsOptions`; works with Hono, h3/Nitro, Express, Fastify, Next.js, Elysia, NestJS
  - **`clearMemoryLogs(store?)`** — reset a store, useful in tests
  - **Environment variables** — `NUXT_EVLOG_MEMORY_STORE` / `EVLOG_MEMORY_STORE`, `NUXT_EVLOG_MEMORY_MAX_EVENTS` / `EVLOG_MEMORY_MAX_EVENTS` (via `resolveAdapterConfig`)
  - **Nuxt module** — `ModuleOptions.axiom` now documents `apiKey` as the canonical field; legacy `token` remains as a deprecated alias until the next major release

  Closes [#349](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/issues/349).

- [#344](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/344) [`5bc3c73`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/5bc3c73c9ed414b53c616b9f20de8b2b981dc145) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add oRPC integration (`evlog/orpc`) with automatic wide-event logging. Two complementary primitives:
  - `withEvlog(handler)` — wraps `RPCHandler` / `OpenAPIHandler` from `@orpc/server/fetch`. Each matched request becomes one wide event with full pipeline support (drain, enrich, `include`/`exclude`, route-based service overrides, tail sampling). Excluded routes still receive a no-op `context.log` so procedures never crash on missing fields.
  - `evlog()` — procedure-level middleware (`os.use(evlog())`). Tags the wide event with `operation` (procedure path joined with `.`), forwards the request logger as `context.log`, promotes the level to `error` when a procedure throws, and bridges `createError()` / `defineErrorCatalog()` throws to `ORPCError` (code, status, message, plus `why`/`fix`/`link` in `data`).

  ```ts
  import { os } from "@orpc/server";
  import { RPCHandler } from "@orpc/server/fetch";
  import { evlog, withEvlog, type EvlogOrpcContext } from "evlog/orpc";

  const base = os.$context<EvlogOrpcContext>().use(evlog());

  const router = {
    ping: base.handler(({ context }) => {
      context.log.set({ pinged: true });
      return { ok: true };
    }),
  };

  const handler = withEvlog(new RPCHandler(router));

  export default async function fetch(request: Request) {
    const { matched, response } = await handler.handle(request, {
      prefix: "/rpc",
    });
    return matched ? response : new Response("Not Found", { status: 404 });
  }
  ```

  `useLogger()` is exposed for off-context access (utility modules / deep service functions). `EvlogOrpcContext` is the type to plug into `os.$context()` for typed access.

  `log.error(err)` populates `error: { name, message, stack, ... }` from the thrown value. When you want to mark the event as `error` (or `warn`) while controlling the `error` field yourself — typed error codes, no stack, custom shapes — call `log.setLevel('error' | 'warn' | 'info' | 'debug')` and pair it with `log.set({ error: { code: 'PAYMENT_DECLINED' } })`. The explicit level wins over the level computed from `.error()` / `.warn()`.

  ```ts
  log.setLevel("error");
  log.set({
    error: { code: "PAYMENT_DECLINED", reason: "insufficient_funds" },
  });
  ```

The module passed native `path.resolve()` paths to `nitro.options.plugins` and `nitro.options.errorHandler`. Nitro raw-interpolates those into the `#nitro/virtual/plugins` and `#nitro/virtual/error-handler` JS string literals, so Windows backslashes were parsed as escape sequences (`\n`, `\v`, …) and broke module resolution — surfacing as `Cannot find module … imported from '#nitro/virtual/error-handler'`. Paths are now normalized to forward slashes before being handed to Nitro.

## 2.17.0

### Minor Changes

- [#332](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/332) [`ced6eda`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/ced6eda8677719bde4c629d8d3692ed7b88a0616) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Tag every drain request with identity headers so receivers can recognize evlog traffic and the originating adapter without parsing the body.
  - `User-Agent: evlog/<version>` on Node / server runtimes (browsers strip `User-Agent`).
  - `X-Evlog-Source: <adapter>` (`axiom`, `datadog`, `otlp`, `posthog`, `sentry`, `better-stack`, `hyperdx`, `client` for browser-originated drains).
  - `httpPost` gains `userAgent?: string | false` and `source?: string` options so custom drains can override or suppress the headers.
  - New exports from `evlog/toolkit`: `EVLOG_VERSION`, `EVLOG_USER_AGENT`, `withEvlogIdentityHeaders`.

  Adapters built with `defineHttpDrain()` automatically forward their `name` as `source`. The legacy `sendBatchTo*` helpers in `evlog/axiom`, `evlog/datadog`, `evlog/otlp`, `evlog/posthog`, `evlog/sentry`, and `evlog/better-stack` pass it explicitly.

- [#325](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/325) [`6b06511`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/6b06511504e6650b6691c41536d82c503fdbd65e) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add typed error and audit catalogs as a thin layer over `createError` and `defineAuditAction`. Three new primitives, zero runtime registration, zero init step. The whole feature is opt-in: existing `createError({ code, ... })` and `defineAuditAction(...)` call sites keep working unchanged, with no migration required.

  ```ts
  import { defineErrorCatalog, defineAuditCatalog } from "evlog";

  export const billingErrors = defineErrorCatalog("billing", {
    PAYMENT_DECLINED: {
      status: 402,
      message: "Card declined",
      why: "...",
      fix: "...",
      link: "...",
    },
    INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS: {
      status: 402,
      message: ({
        available,
        required,
      }: {
        available: number;
        required: number;
      }) => `Insufficient funds: $${available}/$${required}`,
    },
  });

  export const billingAudit = defineAuditCatalog("billing", {
    INVOICE_REFUND: { target: "invoice" },
    INVOICE_CREATE: { target: "invoice" },
  });

  throw billingErrors.PAYMENT_DECLINED({ cause: stripeErr });
  throw billingErrors.INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS({ available: 5, required: 100 });
  log.audit(billingAudit.INVOICE_REFUND({ actor, target: { id: "inv_889" } }));
  ```

  New API on the main `evlog` entrypoint:
  - `defineError(code, options)` — single-error factory bound to a stable code. Accepts every existing `EvlogError` field plus a `tags` array and an `internal` defaults object. `message` can be either a string or a typed function whose params become required at the call site.
  - `defineErrorCatalog(prefix, map)` — bundle a record of entries under a common prefix. The wire `code` for each entry is `${prefix}.${KEY}` (UPPER_SNAKE_CASE keys preserved). Catalog metadata (`_codes`, `_prefix`) exposed for introspection.
  - `defineAuditCatalog(prefix, map)` — symmetric primitive for audit actions. Each entry produces a thin wrapper around `defineAuditAction` with the prefix and target type pre-applied. Exposes `_actions` and `_prefix`.

  Type-level upgrade (opt-in, zero runtime cost):
  - `RegisteredErrorCatalogs` and `RegisteredAuditCatalogs` interfaces (empty by default, augmentable via `declare module 'evlog'`).
  - New `ErrorCode` and `AuditAction` types derived from registered catalogs.
  - `ErrorOptions.code` and `ParsedError.code` now typed as `ErrorCode | (string & {})` — autocomplete on registered codes everywhere (`createError`, `parseError`, custom helpers) without breaking ad-hoc string usage.

  Catalog factories return regular `EvlogError` instances and `AuditInput` objects respectively, so they integrate transparently with every existing evlog primitive (HTTP serializers, `parseError`, wide event capture, audit pipeline, drains). Catalogs are pure data — package them as npm libraries (one prefix per package), and the typing flows transitively to consumers via the published `.d.ts`. No global init, no proxy, no string-based dispatch helper.

- [#332](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/332) [`ced6eda`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/ced6eda8677719bde4c629d8d3692ed7b88a0616) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add `readFsLogs()` and `tailFsLogs()` to `evlog/fs` so any external Node tool can replay or follow the local NDJSON drain without hooking into the running app. The `fs` adapter has been write-only until now; this closes the loop.

  ```ts
  import { readFsLogs, tailFsLogs } from "evlog/fs";

  // Replay history (ends when the last file is read)
  for await (const event of readFsLogs({
    since: "2026-03-01",
    level: "error",
  })) {
    // ...
  }

  // Live tail (yields existing then keeps yielding new ones — abort via AbortSignal)
  const ac = new AbortController();
  for await (const event of tailFsLogs({ signal: ac.signal })) {
    // ...
  }
  ```

  Both helpers accept `dir`, `since`, `until`, `level`, and a custom `filter` predicate. `tailFsLogs` additionally takes `pollIntervalMs`, `fromEnd`, and `signal`. Files outside the date window are skipped without being opened, malformed lines are silently skipped, and partial-write chunks are reassembled across polls.

  Useful for post-incident triage scripts, Vitest e2e assertions on emitted wide events, replay-to-Axiom backfills, and `grep`-style CLIs that pipe filtered events into `jq`.

- [#332](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/332) [`ced6eda`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/ced6eda8677719bde4c629d8d3692ed7b88a0616) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add a local Server-Sent Events stream server so any consumer (browser tab, CLI, devtool) can subscribe to live wide events without going through your app's API surface. The server runs in the same Node process on its own ephemeral port; the URL is printed at startup and written to `.evlog/stream.url` for tools to discover.

  Strict opt-in for the framework integrations: the Nuxt module and the Next.js `defineStreamedInstrumentation` helper only boot the server when `stream: true` (or a config object) is passed. `startStreamServer()` itself is always an explicit call — call it from any standalone script or framework wiring that doesn't have a built-in evlog config.

  **Nuxt**

  ```ts [nuxt.config.ts]
  evlog: {
    stream: true,
    // or: stream: { port: 4317, token: process.env.EVLOG_STREAM_TOKEN }
  }
  ```

  **Next.js** — new helper in `evlog/next/stream`:

  ```ts [lib/evlog.ts]
  import { defineStreamedInstrumentation } from "evlog/next/stream";

  export const { register, onRequestError } = defineStreamedInstrumentation({
    service: "my-app",
    stream: true,
  });
  ```

  **Standalone / any framework**:

  ```ts
  import { startStreamServer } from "evlog/stream";

  const server = await startStreamServer();
  // pass server.drain wherever you compose your evlog drain
  ```

  The Nuxt module also registers a tiny `/api/_evlog/stream-info` route that returns the mini-server URL so a same-origin browser tab can discover the ephemeral port.

  API surface in `evlog/stream`:
  - `startStreamServer(options): Promise<StreamServer>` — `node:http` server bound to `127.0.0.1` by default, idempotent, lazy-imports Node-only modules so `evlog/stream` stays edge-friendly for the in-process primitive.
  - `StreamServerOptions`: `port`, `host`, `token`, `heartbeatMs`, `buffer`, `banner`, `urlFileDir`.
  - `StreamServer`: `{ url, port, drain, stream, close }`.
  - Cleans up `.evlog/stream.url` and listeners on `close()` + `SIGINT` / `SIGTERM` / `exit`.

  Wire format is a versioned JSON envelope `{ evlog: "1", type, data }` with frames `hello`, `replay`, `event`, and `ping`.

  **Local-only by design.** The server is in-process — on serverless platforms (Vercel Functions, Cloudflare Workers, AWS Lambda) each invocation is isolated, so a subscriber would only see events from its own isolate. Use a real broker for cross-instance fan-out in those environments.

The npm-shipped `README.md` and a single JSDoc `@see` URL have been updated to point to the new locations.

  Old documentation URLs continue to work via 301 redirects defined in `apps/docs/config/redirects.ts`. No public API changed.

  If you bookmarked specific documentation pages, the most common moves are:

  Both integrations now listen for the underlying socket `close` event in addition to `finish`. When the client aborts before `res.end()` resolves, the wide event is still emitted (with the same `status`, `duration`, and accumulated context) and tagged with `connectionClosed: true` so disconnects are observable in your drain. The first event to fire wins, so successful responses are unaffected.

  For background work that must outlive the HTTP response (resumable streams, post-response usage accounting), continue to use `req.log.fork('label', fn)` — once the request logger has been emitted it is sealed.

  Closes [#305](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/issues/305).

## 2.16.0

### Minor Changes

- [#318](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/318) [`8080662`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/8080662e0ba2b3746aebf0aa1c5cf89756c3c44d) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add an optional `code` field to `createError` / `EvlogError` so structured errors can carry a stable, machine-readable identifier for client branching, dashboards, and future error-catalog tooling. Foundation for an upcoming `defineErrorCatalog` primitive.

  ```ts
  import { createError, parseError } from "evlog";

  throw createError({
    code: "PAYMENT_DECLINED",
    message: "Payment failed",
    status: 402,
    why: "Card declined by issuer",
    fix: "Try a different payment method",
  });

  // Client
  const err = parseError(caught);
  if (err.code === "PAYMENT_DECLINED") retryWithDifferentCard();
  ```

  `code` is public and propagates through every existing serialization path with no breaking change:
  - **HTTP responses** — surfaces under `data.code` via the existing `EvlogError.data` getter (Nitro v2/v3, Next.js, and any framework using `serializeEvlogErrorResponse` get it for free).
  - **`parseError(err)`** — new `code` field on `ParsedError`. Extracted from EvlogError JSON, h3-style `data.code`, and Node-style `Error.code` (e.g. `'ENOENT'`, `'ECONNRESET'`) so existing system errors flow through the same client branch.
  - **Wide events** — copied onto `event.error.code` so drains and dashboards can group, alert, and chart by code without parsing free-text messages.
  - **`toString()`** — renders a `Code:` line for terminal pretty-print.

  Out of scope here (planned next): `defineErrorCatalog` for centralized typed code unions, plus the equivalent for audit actions.

## 2.15.0

### Minor Changes

- [#315](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/315) [`9b3739b`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/9b3739ba97a1723c56c3f276b1cbea052990a5e5) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Refactor core & toolkit into composable building blocks (EVL-155). The internal helpers that powered every built-in adapter, enricher, and framework integration are now public under `evlog/toolkit`, alongside three new factories and a canonical config entry point.

  **This release is fully backwards-compatible.** Every previously-working snippet keeps working — adapter renames ship with deprecated aliases, the dual PostHog factory is kept as a thin wrapper, and the new toolkit primitives are additive. Nothing to migrate.

  ### What's new
  - **`definePlugin()`** — single canonical extension contract. A plugin can opt into any subset of `setup`, `enrich`, `drain`, `keep`, `onRequestStart`, `onRequestFinish`, `onClientLog`, `extendLogger`. Drains and enrichers are now sugar over plugins (`drainPlugin`, `enricherPlugin`).
  - **`defineHttpDrain()`** — adapter factory. Provide `resolve()` (config) and `encode()` (payload); retries, timeouts, batching, and error isolation are handled for you. All 8 built-in adapters (Axiom, OTLP, HyperDX, PostHog, Sentry, Better Stack, Datadog, FS) now use this internally.
  - **`defineEnricher()`** — enricher factory. Provide `compute()`; merge, error isolation, and undefined skipping are handled for you. All 4 built-in enrichers (UserAgent, Geo, RequestSize, TraceContext) now use this internally.
  - **`defineFrameworkIntegration()`** — manifest-mode framework integration. Provide `extractRequest`, `attachLogger`, and an optional `storage`; the helper handles header normalization, request-id generation, ALS, and `log.fork()` attachment. Hono, Express, Fastify, and Elysia now use this internally.
  - **`defineEvlog()`** — canonical config object. One shape that works across `initLogger`, framework middlewares, the Nuxt module, and Workers via `toLoggerConfig` / `toMiddlewareOptions`.
  - **Composers**: `composeEnrichers`, `composeDrains`, `composeKeep`, `composePlugins` for combining multiple extensions with built-in error isolation.
  - **`evlog/toolkit`** is now the public entry point for all building blocks.
  - **`createDefaultEnrichers()`** — shorthand for `composeEnrichers([userAgent, geo, requestSize, traceContext])`.

  ### Standardized naming (additive, with deprecated aliases)

  We've standardized on `apiKey` for any bearer-style secret. The previous names continue to work and emit a one-time deprecation warning:

  | Adapter      | Recommended                       | Still works (deprecated)                    |
  | ------------ | --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
  | Axiom        | `apiKey` / `AXIOM_API_KEY`        | `token` / `AXIOM_TOKEN`                     |
  | Better Stack | `apiKey` / `BETTER_STACK_API_KEY` | `sourceToken` / `BETTER_STACK_SOURCE_TOKEN` |

  Sentry keeps `dsn` (genuinely different format).

  PostHog's two factories are unified — but the old name is still exported:

  ```ts
  // Recommended
  createPostHogDrain({ mode: "events" });

  // Still works (deprecated, re-routes to the line above)
  createPostHogEventsDrain();
  ```

  These deprecated aliases will be removed in the next **major** release.

  ### Adoption

  Existing code keeps working. To opt into the new primitives:

  ```ts
  import { defineEvlog, defineHttpDrain, definePlugin } from "evlog/toolkit";
  ```

  See [Toolkit Reference](https://evlog.dev/adapters/building-blocks/toolkit) for the complete public API.

They run nightly via a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow plus on PRs labelled `e2e`, so any breaking change on a destination platform is caught within 24 hours instead of in production.

  The Axiom suite does a full round-trip — it ingests events tagged with a unique correlation ID, queries them back via APL, and asserts presence and shape. PostHog/Sentry/Better Stack are smoke-tested (their write APIs don't expose a read path).

  Pure infra: no user-facing API change, no published code change.

Optional peers still led npm to resolve Better Auth’s peer graph (including `@sveltejs/kit` / Vite), causing `ERESOLVE` for apps that do not use Better Auth ([#299](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/issues/299)). Users of `evlog/better-auth` should keep `better-auth` as a direct dependency (see docs).

- [#298](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/298) [`02c4c03`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/02c4c033afff95a8b7ce2d6f1e2ee85c5d0234b2) Thanks [@M-Hassan-Raza](https://github.com/M-Hassan-Raza)! - Avoid unnecessary Nitro runtime-config probes when drain adapter overrides or env vars already satisfy the env-backed config fields.

- [#306](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/306) [`570d675`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/570d675ed70d472ba108cfa9143dcc23e347081c) Thanks [@shubh73](https://github.com/shubh73)! - Detect browser environments for `%c` console styling using `isBrowser()` (window, document, and non–React Native `navigator.product`) so React Native / Metro no longer prints format strings and CSS arguments as literal text when `window` is polyfilled. `isClient()` / `isServer()` are unchanged for existing consumers.

## 2.14.0

### Minor Changes

- [#295](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/295) [`aa9984f`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/aa9984f50259b292e8d1a2a671b600fcb74844db) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Expose AI SDK execution metadata as a public API on `AILogger`. Three new methods let app code read the same data that gets attached to wide events: `getMetadata()` returns an immutable snapshot of the run (model, provider, tokens, calls, steps, tool calls, cost, finish reason, embeddings), `getEstimatedCost()` returns the dollar cost computed from the configured pricing map, and `onUpdate(cb)` subscribes to incremental snapshots emitted on every step, embedding, error, and integration finish (returns an unsubscribe function). New types `AIMetadata` (alias for `AIEventData`) and `AIMetadataListener` are exported. `model` and `provider` on `AIMetadata` are now optional to reflect early-snapshot reality (e.g. embedding-only runs).

- [#302](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/302) [`7060006`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/70600062eeafd86bd4e76d30aae3789434ca7f9b) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add first-class audit logs as a thin layer over existing evlog primitives. Audit is not a parallel system: it is a typed `audit` field on the wide event plus a few opt-in helpers and drain wrappers. Companies already running evlog can enable audit logs by adding 1 enricher + 1 drain wrapper + `log.audit()`, with zero new sub-exports.

  New API on the main `evlog` entrypoint:
  - `AuditFields` reserved on `BaseWideEvent` (`action`, `actor`, `target`, `outcome`, `reason`, `changes`, `causationId`, `correlationId`, `version`, `idempotencyKey`, `context`, `signature`, `prevHash`, `hash`) plus `AUDIT_SCHEMA_VERSION`.
  - `log.audit(fields)` and `log.audit.deny(reason, fields)` on `RequestLogger` and the return value of `createLogger()`. Sugar over `log.set({ audit })` that also force-keeps the event through tail sampling.
  - Standalone `audit(fields)` for jobs / scripts / CLIs.
  - `withAudit({ action, target, actor? })(fn)` higher-order wrapper that auto-emits `success` / `failure` / `denied` based on the wrapped function's outcome (with `AuditDeniedError` for AuthZ refusals).
  - `defineAuditAction(name, opts)` typed action registry, `auditDiff(before, after)` redact-aware JSON Patch helper, `mockAudit()` test utility (`expectIncludes`, `expectActionCount`, `clear`, `restore`).
  - `auditEnricher({ tenantId?, betterAuth? })` enricher that auto-fills `event.audit.context` (`requestId`, `traceId`, `ip`, `userAgent`, `tenantId`) and optionally bridges `actor` from a session.
  - `auditOnly(drain, { await? })` drain wrapper that filters to events with `event.audit` set, optionally awaiting writes for crash safety. `signed(drain, { strategy: 'hmac' | 'hash-chain', ... })` generic tamper-evidence wrapper with pluggable `state.{load,save}` for hash chains.
  - `auditRedactPreset` strict PII preset composable with existing `RedactConfig`.

  Audit events are always force-kept by tail sampling and get a deterministic `idempotencyKey` derived from `action + actor + target + timestamp` so retries are safe across drains. Schema is OTEL-compatible and the `actor.type === 'agent'` slot carries `model`, `tools`, `reason`, `promptId` for AI agent auditing. No new sub-exports were added.

## 2.13.0

### Minor Changes

- [#280](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/280) [`fa0ee26`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/fa0ee267a10d65164b4aec6caa64208ce08af291) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add `evlog/better-auth` integration for automatic user identification from [Better Auth](https://better-auth.com/) sessions.

  **New exports** (`evlog/better-auth`):
  - `identifyUser(log, session, options?)` — sets `userId`, `user`, and `session` fields on a wide event. Returns `true` if identified
  - `createAuthMiddleware(auth, options?)` — framework-agnostic `(log, headers, path?) => Promise<boolean>` with route filtering, timing capture, and lifecycle hooks
  - `createAuthIdentifier(auth, options?)` — Nitro `request` hook factory for standalone Nitro apps
  - `maskEmail(email)` — utility to mask emails for safe logging (`h***@example.com`)
  - `BetterAuthInstance` — reusable type for the auth parameter

  **Features:**
  - `include`/`exclude` route pattern filtering on `createAuthMiddleware`
  - `extend` callback for Better Auth plugin fields (organizations, roles, etc.)
  - `auth.resolvedIn` timing in every wide event
  - `auth.identified` boolean in every wide event
  - `session.userAgent` captured by default
  - `onIdentify`/`onAnonymous` lifecycle hooks
  - `console.warn` in development when session resolution fails

- [#284](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/284) [`861f6d2`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/861f6d2c4e89ca99ef628484a68d69779acf4056) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - `log.set()` concatenates arrays when merging context for the same key. For example, `set({ items: [1, 2] })` followed by `set({ items: [3] })` yields `{ items: [1, 2, 3] }` instead of replacing with `[3]`. Plain objects are still deep-merged recursively; if either the existing or incoming value is not an array, the new value replaces the old one.

  **Breaking change:** Call sites that relied on the last `set` overwriting an array now accumulate elements. To replace a value at emit time, use `emit({ ... })` overrides or a different field name.

## 2.12.0

### Minor Changes

- [#272](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/272) [`2b5c8a4`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/2b5c8a44de2aaeb38b3c9dbb5883e90f88b607b7) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add AI SDK telemetry integration (`createEvlogIntegration`), cost estimation, and enriched embedding capture. `createEvlogIntegration()` implements the AI SDK's `TelemetryIntegration` interface to capture per-tool execution timing/success/errors and total generation wall time. Cost estimation computes `ai.estimatedCost` from a user-provided pricing map. `captureEmbed` now accepts model ID, dimensions, and batch count for richer embedding observability.

- [#271](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/271) [`583fab4`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/583fab4ccd739bb735ad8e816d3bb397f6d08144) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add auto-redaction (PII protection) with smart partial masking, enabled by default in production (`NODE_ENV === 'production'`). Built-in patterns (credit card, email, IPv4, phone, JWT, Bearer, IBAN) use context-preserving masks (e.g. `****1111`, `a***@***.com`) instead of flat `[REDACTED]`. Disabled in development for full debugging visibility. Fine-tune with `paths`, `patterns`, and `builtins`, or opt out with `redact: false`. Custom patterns use the configurable `replacement` string. Redaction runs before console output and before any drain sees the data.

- [#269](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/269) [`037dc81`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/037dc8115001de081c0b524320cafc414346c25c) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add `evlog/http` as the canonical HTTP ingest drain (`createHttpDrain`, `createHttpLogDrain`, `HttpDrainConfig`). Deprecate `evlog/browser`; it re-exports the same API and will be removed in the next **major** release.

- [#266](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/266) [`3898a3f`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/3898a3f0972d21e21cded7dcdcb33e47869002cd) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add `minLevel` for a deterministic severity threshold on the global `log` API and client `initLog`, plus `setMinLevel()` for runtime toggling in the browser. Orthogonal to probabilistic `sampling.rates`; request wide events from `useLogger` / `createLogger().emit()` are unchanged. Includes `isLevelEnabled()` helper and wiring for Nuxt, Vite, and Next.js.

  **2026-04-11** — Playground: interactive panel to try client `minLevel` / `setMinLevel` and trigger logs per level.

### Patch Changes

- [#270](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/270) [`79cb4a4`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/79cb4a4e6a9300df2758f62ad1dda4794f9b4f05) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add an [AWS Lambda](https://www.evlog.dev/frameworks/aws-lambda) guide to the documentation site (`initLogger` once, `createLogger` per invocation, manual `emit`).

## 2.11.1

### Patch Changes

- [#261](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/261) [`08cab7b`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/08cab7b8e3e7d9e8179cf7add784349acd3632ea) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Fix Nuxt `evlog` options not reaching the Nitro plugin in dev: the Nuxt module now mirrors standalone Nitro by setting `process.env.__EVLOG_CONFIG` during `nitro:config`. When `enabled` is `false`, the Nitro plugins still attach a no-op request logger so `useLogger(event)` does not throw.

## 2.11.0

### Minor Changes

- [#249](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/249) [`72d7d6e`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/72d7d6e57c9341fb2a1df78c3f80588ca50b08f5) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add `internal` to `createError` / `ErrorOptions`: backend-only context stored on `EvlogError`, included in wide events via `log.error()`, never serialized in HTTP responses or `toJSON()` ([EVL-140](https://linear.app/evlog/issue/EVL-140)).

- [#251](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/251) [`19ae4a9`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/19ae4a98e0da89c4b1ea0e00f32e238927da1fbb) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add Datadog Logs HTTP drain adapter (`evlog/datadog`): `createDatadogDrain()`, `sendToDatadog` / `sendBatchToDatadog`, env vars `DD_API_KEY` / `NUXT_DATADOG_*` / `DD_SITE`, and intake URL for all Datadog sites. Maps wide events with a short `message` line, full payload under `evlog`, severity `status`, and recursive `httpStatusCode` renaming so HTTP `status` fields never clash with Datadog’s reserved severity ([EVL-144](https://linear.app/evlog/issue/EVL-144)).

### Patch Changes

- [#245](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/245) [`c96967b`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/c96967bdff5b4e5d423f59cea436cd57cb281b57) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Fix Nitro server builds on strict Worker presets (e.g. `cloudflare-durable`) by avoiding Rollup-resolvable literals for `nitro/runtime-config` in published dist. Centralize runtime config access in an internal bridge (`__EVLOG_CONFIG` first, then dynamic `import()` with computed module specifiers for Nitro v3 and nitropack). Add regression tests for dist output and a `cloudflare-durable` production build using the compiled plugin.

- [#242](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/242) [`24c9a80`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/24c9a80289561584f6b302a5e1b5419b8aac7401) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Export `createError`, `createEvlogError`, `EvlogError`, and `parseError` from `evlog/nitro/v3` so Nitro v3 apps can use the documented single import path alongside `useLogger` ([#241](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/issues/241)).

- [#247](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/247) [`730c984`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/730c984c16bf1543da6525caa6aa5ca788f64306) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Align `evlogErrorHandler` with TanStack Start’s `createMiddleware().server()` types: widen `next()` to sync-or-async results, match `RequestServerFn` return typing via `RequestServerResult`, and declare an optional peer on `@tanstack/start-client-core` for accurate declarations ([#235](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/issues/235), [EVL-142](https://linear.app/evlog/issue/EVL-142)).

## 2.10.0

### Minor Changes

- [#225](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/225) [`3d1dcd4`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/3d1dcd4678da83c05e754623b7443426231565ab) Thanks [@izadoesdev](https://github.com/izadoesdev)! - Add HyperDX drain adapter (`evlog/hyperdx`) for OTLP/HTTP ingest, with defaults aligned to [HyperDX OpenTelemetry documentation](https://hyperdx.io/docs/install/opentelemetry) (`https://in-otel.hyperdx.io`, `authorization` header). Includes docs site and `review-logging-patterns` skill updates.

- [#232](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/232) [`767ba27`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/767ba2702c5e8c254360c315c76491128bd54169) Thanks [@MrLightful](https://github.com/MrLightful)! - Add configurable `credentials` (`RequestCredentials`, default `same-origin`) for the client log transport and browser drain `fetch` calls. The Nuxt module forwards `transport.credentials` into `runtimeConfig.public.evlog` so client `initLog()` receives it.

### Patch Changes

- [#228](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/228) [`4385dbc`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/4385dbc6551577388123b77bcfaf3d709897ee08) Thanks [@shubh73](https://github.com/shubh73)! - Resolve Nitro runtime config in drain adapters via dynamic `import()` (Cloudflare Workers and other runtimes without `require`). Cache Nitro module namespaces after first load to avoid repeated imports on every drain. Fix HyperDX drain to `await` `resolveAdapterConfig()` so env/runtime config is applied when using `createHyperDXDrain()` without inline overrides.

- [#188](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/188) [`e3ebe9f`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/e3ebe9faeac8bce7091ba9a8d90b31e8d66e4f43) Thanks [@mnismt](https://github.com/mnismt)! - Add `defineNodeInstrumentation()` for Next.js root `instrumentation.ts`: gate on `NEXT_RUNTIME === 'nodejs'`, cache the dynamic `import()` of `lib/evlog` between `register` and `onRequestError`, and export `NextInstrumentationRequest` / `NextInstrumentationErrorContext` types.

## 2.9.0

### Minor Changes

- [#212](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/212) [`96c47cd`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/96c47cd3adfbaf0e6c53db9be55b45f652dfbdb8) Thanks [@MrLightful](https://github.com/MrLightful)! - Add React Router middleware integration (`evlog/react-router`) with automatic wide-event logging, drain, enrich, and tail sampling support

### Patch Changes

- [#220](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/220) [`b0c26d5`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/b0c26d5eacb2382402a0ab99744650796ea52be7) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - fix(nitro): make `evlogErrorHandler` compatible with TanStack Start's `createMiddleware().server()` API

  `evlogErrorHandler` now accepts both `(next)` and `({ next })` signatures, so `createMiddleware().server(evlogErrorHandler)` works directly without a wrapper in all TanStack Start versions.

- [#215](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/215) [`31cb4ab`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/31cb4ab903c969107a368cb5a9629eff6fe0c63b) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - fix(nitro): always create logger in request hook so `useLogger()` works in server middleware

  Previously, calling `useLogger(event)` inside a Nuxt server middleware would throw `"Logger not initialized"` because the Nitro plugin skipped logger creation for routes not matching `include` patterns. Since middleware runs for every request, this made it impossible to use `useLogger` there.

  The `shouldLog` filtering is now evaluated at emit time instead of creation time — the logger is always available on `event.context.log`, but events for non-matching routes are silently discarded.

- [#218](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/218) [`453a548`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/453a5483d1a7b2db7979edbc306cd9b9584e9f40) Thanks [@benhid](https://github.com/benhid)! - fix(parseError): respect `.status` / `.statusCode` on Error instances instead of hardcoding 500

  Frameworks like NestJS attach HTTP status directly on Error subclasses (e.g. `BadRequestException` has `.status = 400`). Previously, `parseError()` ignored these properties and always returned 500 for any `Error` instance without a `data` property. Now uses `extractErrorStatus()` to extract the correct status.

- [#219](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/219) [`79f811d`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/79f811dab02717470ed5f178b5c944a395dc4025) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Improve TanStack Start documentation with route filtering, pipeline (batching & retry), tail sampling sections, Vite plugin callout, and TanStack Router vs TanStack Start disambiguation

## 2.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#196](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/196) [`abda28c`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/abda28cc00b6276a59c2cf9dcfca295f4d7b878c) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add `evlog/ai` integration for AI SDK v6+ observability.
  - `createAILogger(log)` returns an `AILogger` with `wrap()` and `captureEmbed()`
  - Model middleware captures token usage, tool calls, finish reason, and streaming metrics
  - Supports `generateText`, `streamText`, `generateObject`, `streamObject`, and `ToolLoopAgent`
  - Accumulates data across multi-step agent runs (steps, models, tokens)
  - String model IDs resolved via `gateway()` with full autocompletion
  - Gateway provider parsing extracts actual provider and model name
  - Streaming metrics: `msToFirstChunk`, `msToFinish`, `tokensPerSecond`
  - Cache tokens (`cacheReadTokens`, `cacheWriteTokens`) and reasoning tokens tracked
  - Error capture from failed model calls and stream error chunks
  - `captureEmbed()` for embedding calls (`embed`, `embedMany`)
  - `ai` is an optional peer dependency

- [#189](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/189) [`d92fb46`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/d92fb46b2d272dca0de73a0ffedda746304f57b6) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add `evlog/vite` plugin for build-time DX enhancements in any Vite-based framework.
  - Zero-config auto-initialization via Vite `define` (no `initLogger()` needed)
  - Build-time `log.debug()` stripping in production builds (default)
  - Source location injection (`__source: 'file:line'`) for object-form log calls
  - Opt-in auto-imports for `log`, `createEvlogError`, `parseError`
  - Client-side logger injection via `transformIndexHtml`
  - New `evlog/client` public entrypoint
  - Nuxt module gains `strip` and `sourceLocation` options (no breaking changes)

### Patch Changes

- [#197](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/pull/197) [`3601d30`](https://github.com/HugoRCD/evlog/commit/3601d303c122509a8f665f20e8275248e6e6e7f5) Thanks [@HugoRCD](https://github.com/HugoRCD)! - Add retry with exponential backoff to all HTTP drain adapters and improve timeout error messages.
  - Transient failures (timeouts, network errors, 5xx) are retried up to 2 times with exponential backoff (200ms, 400ms)
  - `AbortError` timeout errors now display a clear message: `"Axiom request timed out after 5000ms"` instead of the cryptic `"DOMException [AbortError]: This operation was aborted"`
  - New `retries` option on all adapter configs (Axiom, OTLP, Sentry, PostHog, Better Stack)
  - 4xx client errors are never retried
