# Test conventions

Goals: fast (full suite < 2s locally), deterministic, no fake-greens, no console-parsing.

## Decision table

| You want to verify | Use this |
|---|---|
| An HTTP request emitted a wide event with given fields | `createPipelineSpies()` + `assertHttpEventEmitted(drain, { path, method, status, level })` from `helpers/framework.ts` |
| A drain spy was called within a few microtasks of a request returning | `await waitForDrainCalls(drain)` before drilling into `drain.mock.calls` |
| A specific event field is set after `log.set(...)` | `findEventViaDrain(drain, e => e.path === ...)` then assert on the returned event |
| A duration / threshold-based behavior | `vi.useFakeTimers()` + `vi.advanceTimersByTime(N)` + `vi.useRealTimers()` (do *not* `await new Promise(setTimeout)`) |
| Narrowing after `expect(x).toBeDefined()` | `defined(x, 'label')` from `helpers/defined.ts` — not `x!` |
| Accessing the request logger inside a route handler test | `useLogger()` — not `req.log!` (keep one test per framework that asserts `req.log` is attached) |
| An adapter posts the right URL / body / headers | `mockFetch()` from `helpers/fetch.ts` + `getFetchCall` / `getFetchJson` / `getFetchHeaders` |
| A wide event factory for adapter tests | `makeWideEvent(overrides?)` from `helpers/events.ts` |
| The sweep of HTTP framework specs ("emits event", "x-request-id", "route service") | `describeStandardHttpMatrix({ name, mount })` from `helpers/frameworkMatrix.ts` — wired in all seven HTTP framework test files |

## Framework runtime fidelity

This is the most important table in the file. For each framework integration we
verify the test really exercises the framework's runtime, not a substitute.

| Framework | How tests fire requests | What's actually exercised |
|---|---|---|
| `frameworks/express.test.ts` | `request(app)` (supertest) binds an ephemeral HTTP port | Real Express middleware chain, real Node socket lifecycle |
| `frameworks/hono.test.ts` | `app.request(...)` Fetch API | Real Hono router, real handler dispatch |
| `frameworks/fastify.test.ts` | `app.inject(...)` (Light My Request) | Real Fastify lifecycle (preHandler / handler / response hooks) |
| `frameworks/elysia.test.ts` | `app.handle(new Request(...))` | Real Elysia handler |
| `frameworks/nestjs.test.ts` | Extracts middleware via `EvlogModule.configure()` and mounts on Express | Module API + the Connect-style middleware itself; **does NOT boot NestFactory** |
| `frameworks/nestjs-real-runtime.test.ts` | `Test.createTestingModule(...)` + `app.init()` + supertest | **Real NestFactory boot, real DI, real exception filter pipeline** |
| `frameworks/react-router.test.ts` | Calls middleware directly with `new RouterContextProvider()` from `react-router` | Real react-router context provider (set/get semantics, throws on missing) |
| `frameworks/sveltekit.test.ts` | Calls handle directly with `{ event, resolve }` | The SvelteKit-recommended testing contract; cannot run through `sequence()` because that needs the SvelteKit request-store runtime |
| `next/handler.test.ts` | `await handler(new Request(...))` | Identical to how Next App Router invokes route handlers |
| `next/instrumentation.test.ts` | Calls `register()` + simulates `process.stdout.write` patches | The actual Node instrumentation contract |
| `next/middleware.test.ts` | Calls `evlogMiddleware()` with mocked `NextResponse.next` | Edge middleware contract (Next has no Node-friendly real runtime for edge middleware) |

**Rule of thumb**: if the framework has a Node-friendly request driver (`inject`,
`request`, `handle`, `Test.createTestingModule`, supertest), the test must use
it. If the framework has no such driver (SvelteKit's full router needs `vite preview`,
Next's edge middleware needs the Edge runtime), the test calls the user-facing
contract directly with realistic input shapes.

**Found a fake test?** Move it. The `nestjs-real-runtime.test.ts` exists exactly
because the original `nestjs.test.ts` extracted the middleware from
`EvlogModule.configure()` — convenient for unit-testing the middleware function,
but it bypassed NestJS's exception filter, request scope, and Express adapter
boot. Both files coexist now: the original tests the module API surface fast;
the real-runtime version catches integration regressions.

## Anti-patterns (do not do)

1. `vi.spyOn(console, 'info')` then `find(call => includes('"path":"/x"'))` then `JSON.parse(call[0])`. Use a drain spy instead.
2. Re-implementing `shouldLog` / `getServiceForPath` / similar source helpers locally to "test the logic". Import the real export — anything else is a false-green machine.
3. `await new Promise(r => setTimeout(r, N))` for timing assertions. Use fake timers; `setTimeout` couples the test to wall-clock and CI load.
4. `expect(x).toBeDefined()` as the *only* assertion. Always drill at least one level deeper.
5. Adding a new export to `package.json` without updating `tsdown.config.ts` and re-running `pnpm test` so `api-surface.test.ts` snapshots the new surface.
6. Non-null assertions (`!`) and type casts (`as`) when a helper or guard can express the same intent — use `defined()`, `getDrainCallArg()`, `useLogger()`, or `expect(...).toEqual(...)`.

## File layout

Layout mirrors `src/`. Pick the folder that matches the source area you're touching.

```

Decision tree:

- "I touched `src/<area>.ts`" → `test/<area>/...` exists; add the test there. If it doesn't, that's a coverage gap — flag it.
- "I added a new framework integration" → `test/frameworks/<name>.test.ts` and consult § Framework runtime fidelity for the right driver.
- "I added a new drain adapter" → `test/adapters/<name>.test.ts` (use `helpers/fetch.ts`) + `test/e2e/<name>.e2e.ts` gated on env vars.

## Running

```bash
pnpm test                                       # full suite
pnpm exec vitest run test/core/redact.test.ts   # one file
pnpm test:coverage                              # with v8 coverage + thresholds
pnpm test:e2e                                   # real network (skipped without API keys)
pnpm run mutate                                 # Stryker (slow; weekly cron in CI)
```

## Coverage thresholds

The thresholds in [`packages/evlog/vitest.config.ts`](../vitest.config.ts) (`statements` / `branches` / `functions` / `lines`) are kept ~3 points below the measured baseline so a real regression fails CI but flaky-but-fast metrics don't generate false alarms.

Bumping them up:

1. Run `pnpm test:coverage` locally and capture the new percentages.
2. Edit `vitest.config.ts` to set the new floor (still ~3 points below the new baseline).
3. The PR must include the coverage output in the description so a reviewer can sanity-check before merging.

Lowering them is a smell — every drop needs a comment explaining why and an issue / follow-up to restore.

`vitest.config.ts` is the single source of truth for the numbers; this section is only the policy.

## Slow test budget

Set `EVLOG_SLOW_TEST_BUDGET_MS=300 CI=1 pnpm test` to surface tests above 300ms
(default 500). The CI run prints the top 20 offenders without failing.

## CI structure

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs five independent jobs in parallel on every PR:

- `lint` — `pnpm run dev:prepare` + `pnpm run lint`
- `typecheck` — `pnpm run dev:prepare` + `pnpm run typecheck`
- `test` — `pnpm run dev:prepare` + `pnpm run build:package`, then `vitest run --shard=N/4` across a 4-way matrix
- `coverage` — `pnpm run dev:prepare` + `pnpm run build:package` + `pnpm --filter evlog run test:coverage` (enforces the thresholds in `vitest.config.ts`)
- `publish` — needs all of the above; runs `pkg-pr-new publish` for evlog + nuxthub on PR / main / manual dispatch

Mutation testing is intentionally separate: `.github/workflows/mutation.yml` runs Stryker on a weekly Monday cron and on `workflow_dispatch` (Stryker is too slow to gate every PR).
