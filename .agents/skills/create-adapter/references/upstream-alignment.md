# Upstream alignment pins

One row per drain adapter that talks to a third-party API. The row names the authority an adapter is measured against: the provider's ingest documentation and the file in the provider's own client that builds the request. `adapter-alignment` (Evi, twice a month) reads the pinned version, diffs the request shape against ours, and moves the pin forward once the two agree. A new adapter adds its row in the same PR.

`fs`, `memory`, and `nuxthub` have no upstream and no row.

`Aligned to` is the client's published version and the evlog commit that last matched it, written as `@sentry/core 11.2.0 @ 5e0d543`. `unset` means no run has compared the two yet; the first run over that adapter writes the first pin and files every mismatch it finds along the way.

## What a comparison covers

Read both sides for the same request and record each difference as a mismatch with the upstream line as evidence:

- endpoint, path, and the default region or site;
- authentication header name and scheme;
- content type, compression, and batch limits (bytes, events, or both);
- the field each side uses for timestamp, level, message, service, and attributes, and how nested objects are shaped;
- the level or severity mapping;
- retry, backoff, and the status codes that stop a retry;
- user-agent or SDK identification headers the provider documents as expected;
- options the provider deprecated or renamed since the pin.

A mismatch where evlog is more conservative than the client (a smaller batch, a stricter timeout) is a note, not a finding. A mismatch that changes what the provider stores or how it indexes is a finding.
